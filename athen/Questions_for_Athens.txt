ACCEPTANCE TESTS

Regarding your question: the acceptance tests are needed in order to make sure that new releases of the GPII do not affect the integration of the various units/components/applications. In the near future we will run these tests weekly. Since your application interacts with GPII, there should be an acceptance test for it.
Of course, there comes the question if other people can run the tests without having access to the actual device. I think it is best to discuss this with Kasper in Athens next week, as he can answer this from the side of the architecture team.

Best regards,
