Hi Manuel, 

attached you find a lengthy explanation of how I would describe the integration of a web application to someone new to the GPII. Maybe it is a bit boring and too detailed for us, who know it and have experience with the system. But in order to really be inclusive, also to not that experienced web application developers, I think one can not be too clear, make too much examples or use too simple language. 

http://blogs.cloud4all.info/developers/information-about-your-solution/integrating-a-web-based-solution/ 
I think this entry should explain how a native application is integrated, and then piont out the differences for a web application. 

In section 1 there is a link to http://blogs.cloud4all.info/developers/download-gpii-for-windows-7/
In this installation description the installation of nodes is omitted, whereas at the wiki it is described to be necessary.
The download link there points to an (old?) integrated(??) version on a google drive, 
which installs node v. 0.8.25, installs MINGW, which for this pupose is not necessary, installs a USBListener which did not run on my PC but caus an error message that libstdc was missing. the web solution is missing, and the config files dat from 13th of september 2014. 

So i would suggest to delete the contents of that page an let it also point to the wiki installation, which points to this download page.  https://demolabs.singularlogic.eu/cloud4all/

paragraph two and three are fine. except from the path to the web solutions file, which would be 
C:\Program Files\GPII\node_modules\universal\testData\solutions\web.json
with the new version.

the first example to be made, might also be a one to one example, like just using the same settings as GPII. 

then number 4 and transformations may be explained. 
the link provided it correct, but maybe confusing for people new to JSON, becase there are "s missing in some examples: 
http://wiki.gpii.net/w/Architecture_-_Available_transformation_functions#Conditional transform (fluid.transforms.condition)
This should be controlled on the whole page. 

Writing acceptance tests is something that I considder a very late stage, firt time visitors should not be bothered with that, but told with whom to talk, if the want thei solution integrated to the GPII.
